# LibraryApp

**LibraryApp** is a simple backend application written in **Java** using **Spring Boot**, created as a learning project to practice clean project structure, business logic separation, and basic testing.

---

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a technical exercise while learning Spring Boot and modern Java backend development practices.

The main goals of the project were:

- understanding Spring Boot project structure,
- implementing basic domain logic,
- separating concerns between layers,
- writing and running unit tests,
- working with Git and GitHub workflows.

This is **not a production-ready application**, but a solid demonstration of backend fundamentals.

## Features

Currently, the application includes:

- basic domain modeling for a library system (e.g. books, users),
- example business logic related to library operations,
- simple data handling (in-memory or configured storage),
- unit tests covering selected parts of the application.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using:

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **JUnit** for testing
- **Gradle** as the build tool
